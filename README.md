# Classification of Amino Acids Using Neural Networks
![](/images/neural_network_classification_of_amino_acids.PNG)

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins which act to mediate countless biological processes. Thus
there is a clear and evident need for a viable sequencing technology for proteins that can encode information
for each amino acid that is easily interpretable. In this work, I seek to demonstrate that electrical and Raman 
spectroscopic signals originating from single amino acids can be used as representations for future sequencing 
technologies. To do this, I implement a deep neural network classifier in Python using TensorFlow to distinguish
a subset of the family of amino acids based upon the information represented in these signals.
